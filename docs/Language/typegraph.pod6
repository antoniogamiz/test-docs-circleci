=SUBTITLE How to setup Perl6::TypeGraph

So you have an amazing hierarchy in the types defined in your module and wants
to show it in your documentation? L<Perl6::TypeGraph|https://github.com/antoniogamiz/Perl6-TypeGraph>
will let you do it!

=heaed2 TypeGraph file

At this moment, L<Perl6::TypeGraph|https://github.com/antoniogamiz/Perl6-TypeGraph> is not able
to automatically detect the hierarchy of a documented class, so you need to provide it with a file
containing that hierarchy.

You two options to specify this file:

=item Use the C<--typegraph-file> to specify a custom path.
=item Creates a file called C<type-graph.txt> file in your module directory.

How to write this file? You need to follow a very easy syntax:

=begin code
[name of the category]
# you can write comments too!
Name::Of::A::Class is Parent::Class does A::ROle
=end code

You can check the L<type-graph.txt file|https://github.com/antoniogamiz/Perl6-Documentable/blob/docs-assets/type-graph.txt>
used by C<Perl6::Documentable> as an example.
